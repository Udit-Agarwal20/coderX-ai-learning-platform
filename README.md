🚀 coderX — AI Learning Intelligence Platform
🏆 Hackathon Submission (AI for Bharat)
coderX is an AI-powered learning intelligence platform designed to transform how students learn programming.

Unlike traditional coding platforms or AI chat assistants that only solve individual doubts, coderX analyzes a student’s complete coding behavior to detect conceptual gaps, track learning patterns, and generate personalized improvement roadmaps.

📌 Problem Statement
Most coding learners:

Repeat the same mistakes without understanding conceptual gaps

Receive generic feedback like “Wrong Answer” or “TLE”

Do not know what to study next

Lack structured, personalized guidance

AI tools solve doubts — but they do not monitor long-term learning growth.

💡 Our Solution
coderX acts as an AI Mentor, not just an AI assistant.

It:

Tracks coding activity

Detects recurring error patterns

Identifies weak programming concepts

Generates personalized learning roadmaps

Recommends adaptive practice problems

Tracks progress over time

It transforms AI from an Answer Engine → Learning Intelligence System.
